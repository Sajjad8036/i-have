✅ Your DevOps Survival & Success Plan (First 30 Days)
🔹 WEEK 1: Core Setup + Daily Practice
🎯 Goal: Be confident in CLI, Git, Jenkins, and EC2
✅ Tasks:
✅ Learn Linux basics: cd, ls, chmod, ps, grep, top, df, netstat, curl

✅ Practice git clone, git branch, git commit, git push, merge, rebase

✅ Launch a free EC2 instance on AWS

✅ Connect via SSH and install tools like Docker, Git, Java

✅ Install Jenkins on EC2 and run your first freestyle job

✅ Write a basic Shell Script to deploy a dummy app

🔧 Tools:
EC2, Git, Linux, Jenkins

🔹 WEEK 2: CI/CD + Docker + Terraform
🎯 Goal: Build and deploy using Docker and CI/CD pipelines
✅ Tasks:
✅ Write a Dockerfile for a simple Node.js or Python app

✅ Build and run container locally

✅ Push Docker image to Docker Hub

✅ Create a Jenkins pipeline job that:

Pulls code from GitHub

Builds a Docker image

Deploys to EC2

✅ Install and configure Terraform to create:

VPC + Subnet + EC2 + S3 bucket

🔧 Tools:
Jenkins, GitHub, Docker, Terraform, EC2

🔹 WEEK 3: AWS Deep Dive + Monitoring + More Terraform
🎯 Goal: Act like a real DevOps engineer on a live project
✅ Tasks:
✅ Practice creating:

IAM roles and policies

S3 buckets with versioning and policies

RDS database (MySQL/Postgres)

✅ Create dashboards in CloudWatch

✅ Practice with Grafana + Prometheus (optional but good)

✅ Use Terraform to deploy:

EC2 with auto-assigned EIP

Security groups

Store state file in S3 (remote backend)

🔧 Tools:
AWS EC2, IAM, S3, RDS, CloudWatch, Terraform

🔹 WEEK 4: Simulate Real Work + Troubleshooting
🎯 Goal: Be job-ready for actual tasks
✅ Tasks:
✅ Build a CI/CD pipeline for a sample app using GitHub → Jenkins → Docker → AWS

✅ Simulate errors:

Docker build fails (fix Dockerfile)

Jenkins job fails (fix script/env issue)

EC2 server unreachable (fix security group)

✅ Do a small monitoring setup for your EC2 using CloudWatch

✅ Review and revise your Terraform code structure (modules, variables, outputs)

💬 Bonus:
Prepare answers for these questions:

What happens when a Jenkins job fails?

How do you roll back a bad deployment?

How do you secure S3 buckets?

What’s the difference between security groups and NACLs?
